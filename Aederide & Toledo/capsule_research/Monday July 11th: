prepare bag for tomorrow morning 

Jul 17th:

1st model to predict E using:
Excipient
Divide on Mups vs Spim
Pellet - may divide further
Compaction Pressure -> look at 40 in particular
Family 
MPS - mean particle size
Span
BD - bulk density 
HR - hausner ratio
Y material yield pressure

July 18th:

Modelling strategy


CP = 40
HR & AoR :  0.827
HR & MPS : -0.741
HR & BD  : -0.936
AoR & MPS: -0.946
Span & Y :  0.754






E, per CP level

Span
MPS
HR
Y
Pellet

Might matter more for spim than nups
